- paragraph: In 1984, the North West Devils were awarded $500 for winning the Bill Bolton Consolation Men's Hockey Championship. Excited and not knowing what to do with the bounty, we decided to put the funds towards a golf tournament and BBQ. The event was so successful it is a ritual. Nearly the entire original Devils continue to take part in the tourney (though none have ever won), much has changed. Most notably, the bachelors have become fathers making their wives and children part of the Buddies. That is what makes it special.
