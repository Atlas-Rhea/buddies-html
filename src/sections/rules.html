          <li><b>Best Ball Format:</b><br>Each player hits from the spot of the previous "best" shot, as chosen by the team. Democracy in action—sort of.</li>
          <li><b>Team Scoring:</b><br>Record one team score per hole. Lowest total wins. Bragging rights included.</li>
          <li><b>Dress Code:</b><br>You can follow golf rules or position yourself to win the coveted Best Dressed, you choose.</li>
          <li><b>Mulligans Are Fiction:</b><br>Mr. Mulligan was not invited. No do-overs. Play it where it lies… even if it's a flowerbed.</li>
          <li><b>No Gimmies:</b><br>Putt it out. The Golf Gods are watching—and they're petty.</li>

          <li><b>Out of Bounds = Out of Bounds:</b><br>Unless it's faster, funnier, or there's a clear path through the woods. Use judgment. Or don't.</li>
          <li><b>Cart Speed Limits Apply:</b><br>Drive responsibly. We've hired invisible speed enforcement. You've been warned.</li>
          <li><b>Lost Ball Protocol:</b><br>If you can't find it in 90 seconds, it's gone. Declare it lost, curse the squirrels, move on.</li>
          <li><b>Cheating Policy:</b><br>Cheating is strictly prohibited—unless it's clever, and no one finds out. In that case, we admire the hustle.</li>
          <li><b>Mandatory Fun Clause:</b><br>If you're not having fun, that's a you problem. Adjust attitude, refill beverage, and carry on.</li>
