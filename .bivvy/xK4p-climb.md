      <Feature Overview>
        <PurposeStatement>
          Ensure the Buddies Open site matches the provided reference images exactly at common mobile breakpoints, both visually and functionally, for a seamless and aesthetic user experience.
        </PurposeStatement>
        <ProblemBeingSolved>
          The current site may not match the design references on mobile, leading to inconsistencies in branding, usability, and visual appeal.
        </ProblemBeingSolved>
        <SuccessMetrics>
          - All sections match their reference images pixel-perfectly at 320px, 375px, 414px, and 480px widths.
          - All interactive elements function as expected on mobile.
          - No visual or logical flow issues remain after iteration.
        </SuccessMetrics>
      </Feature Overview>
      <Requirements>
        <Functional>
          - Each section must visually match its reference image at the specified breakpoints.
          - All links, forms, and buttons must be usable and accessible on mobile.
        </Functional>
        <Technical>
          - Use Playwright MCP for automated screenshot comparison and functional checks.
          - Use Tailwind and custom CSS for adjustments.
        </Technical>
        <User>
          - The site should be easy to navigate and visually pleasing on mobile devices.
        </User>
        <Constraints>
          - No new dependencies may be added.
          - All changes must be compatible with the current Vite/Tailwind setup.
        </Constraints>
      </Requirements>
      <Design and Implementation>
        <UserFlow>
          - User lands on the site on a mobile device.
          - User scrolls through each section, experiencing a seamless, visually consistent flow.
          - All interactive elements are easy to use and visually aligned.
        </UserFlow>
        <ArchitectureOverview>
          - Static HTML sections loaded dynamically.
          - CSS via Tailwind and custom styles.
        </ArchitectureOverview>
        <DependentComponents>
          - None outside the listed files.
        </DependentComponents>
      </Design and Implementation>
      <TestingApproach>
        <TestCases>
          - Visual regression tests for each section at each breakpoint.
          - Functional tests for forms, links, and navigation.
        </TestCases>
        <AcceptanceCriteria>
          - No visual differences between site and reference images at target breakpoints.
          - All interactive elements work as expected.
        </AcceptanceCriteria>
        <EdgeCases>
          - Very small screens (below 320px).
          - Unusual aspect ratios.
        </EdgeCases>
        <PerformanceRequirements>
          - No significant performance regressions on mobile.
        </PerformanceRequirements>
      </TestingApproach>
      <DesignAssets>
        <Mockups>
          - All reference images in ref-png/.
        </Mockups>
        <UserInterfaceGuidelines>
          - Follow reference images for spacing, color, and layout.
        </UserInterfaceGuidelines>
      </DesignAssets>
      <FutureConsiderations>
        <ScalabilityPlans>
          - Approach can be reused for desktop/tablet in the future.
        </ScalabilityPlans>
        <EnhancementIdeas>
          - Add automated CI for visual regression.
        </EnhancementIdeas>
        <KnownLimitations>
          - Only mobile breakpoints are in scope for this Climb.
