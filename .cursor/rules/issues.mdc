description: Promote any bulleted suggestions in assistant output as high-priority Task-Master tasks  
globs: .cursor/rules/*.mdc  
alwaysApply: true

- **Trigger on any bulleted line**  
  - Matches lines beginning with `- ` or `* ` anywhere in the assistant’s output  
  - Catches suggestions or “issues” even if no literal phrase like “understand the issue” appears  

- **Extract and promote each bullet**  
  - Grep for `^[-*] ` to find all bullets  
  - Strip the leading marker to get the clean description  
  - Run `task-master add --title="<desc>" --priority=high` for each  

- **Append to a durable log**  
  - Write a timestamped entry to `.cursor/taskmaster_issues.log`  
  - Records exactly which bullets were promoted  

- **Example rule implementation**  
  ```mdc
  rule PromoteBulletedProblems
  when assistant.output.matches("(?m)^[-*] .+")
  then
    # 1) Extract every bulleted line and add as high-priority task
    shell("echo \"$ASSISTANT_OUTPUT\" \\
      | grep -E '^[-*] ' \\
      | sed 's/^[-*] //' \\
      | while read problem; do \\
          task-master add --title=\"$problem\" --priority=high; \\
        done")
    # 2) Log what was promoted
    shell("echo \"$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') Promoted bullets: \\
      $(echo \"$ASSISTANT_OUTPUT\" \\
         | grep -E '^[-*] ' \\
         | sed 's/^[-*] //' \\
         | paste -sd';' -)\" \\
      >> .cursor/taskmaster_issues.log")
  end
